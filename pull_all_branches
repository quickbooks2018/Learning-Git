git fetch --all and git pull -all will only track the remote branches and track local branches that track remote branches respectively.

But it is not sufficient to track all remote branches

For tracking all remote branches run this command

 for remote in `git branch -r`; do git branch --track ${remote#origin/} $remote; done

Run this command only if there are remote branches on the server which are untracked by your local branches.

Then after this command run 

git fetch --all

git pull --all

Thus, you can fetch all git branches.

On a side note: some will suggest you with

 git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | while read remote; do git branch --track "${remote#origin/}" "$remote"; done

But this will create a local branch named origin/branchname which will give you "refname 'origin/branchname' is ambiguous whenever you referred to it.
